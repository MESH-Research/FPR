    <h2>Style Criteria</h2>
    <p>
      Style criteria are a core component of the Collaborative Review Process.
      Your users will associate their comments with one or more of the style
      criteria you define below. This helps keep the conversation about a
      submission aligned with your publication's core values and focused on
      moving a submission through the review process.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can define up to six style critera and your reviewers are able to
      select mulitple criteria when creating a comment. Reviewers are able to
      bypass the style criteria selection after confirming that their comment
      doesn't fit any of the options presented.
