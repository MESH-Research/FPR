# Documentation

CCR's documentation (the site you're currently reading) is a [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) site located in the `/docs` directory of the repo.  Our goal is to iterate the documentation as features that are added to the application.  All of the documentation files are [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) with some minor Vue additions sprinkled in here and there.

Improving documentation is a great way to help Pilcrow that doesn't require programming experience.

At the bottom of each page, you should find a link to "Edit this Page."  Follow this link straight to the GitHub editing interface!

## Automated Builds

Github Actions powered by [Netlify](https://netlify.com) automatically build and deploy the documentation sites.  There are two automatic builds configured:

- **<https://pilcrow.meshresearch.dev>**: Automatically built from the `master` branch.
- **<https://development.pilcrow.meshresearch.dev>**: Automatically built from the `development` branch.

### Deploy Previews

Any pull request that contains changes to documentation will have a preview build deployed.  These previews are a great way to share proposed documentation changes for feedback and review.

Whenever a deploy preview build is triggered, the Netlify bot will comment on the pull request with a link to view the deployed documentation preview.

## Serving Test Docs Using Lando

It can be helpful to have a locally rendered version to see the results of your changes while editing documentation.  The `/docs` directory has its own [Lando](https://lando.dev) configuration file just for starting up a documentation development environment.

Inside the `/docs` directory, run `lando start` to start the container and proxy.  Once everything is up and running, visit <https://docs.ccr.lndo.site> to view your documentation build.  The container uses a development server, so updates should happen automatically in the browser without requiring a refresh.
