# Internationalization (i18n)

CCR is internationalized using the [vue-i18n package](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/).  All translatable strings in the application are located in
`/client/src/i18n`.

## Contributing Translations

_TODO: Document the process for contributing translations._

In the meantime, if you are interested in contributing a translation, [please reach out to the team via GitHub](https://github.com/MESH-Research/CCR/discussions).

## Translation Tools

### Screenshots
The automated testing tools for the application generate two screenshots of each page.  The first displays the page in `en-US` and the second replaces   translatable strings with their key in the translation files to aid in locating the appropriate key to modify for a given string.

| ![Translated](./images/i18n-copy.png) | ![Keys](./images/i18n-keys.png) |
| :-----------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
| Translated Page            | Translation Keys for Page       |

You can download a zip file of these screenshots inside a [recent run of the integration test suite](https://github.com/MESH-Research/CCR/actions/workflows/test-e2e.yml). Click on a recent run and look for the `screenshots` artifact.  (Note: Screenshots are only saved for 14 days.)

Screenshots are also viewable on CCR's [cypress.io](https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/omnycq/runs) profile. Click on a recent run and locate the "Copywriting Screenshots > Makes Screenshots" spec.  Click on that spec and you should find a button for screenshots in the flyout that opens.

### In-Browser Keys

If you are able to access/start a build of the application, you can also switch to the translation keys display mode by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+T`.  Pressing the key combination again will revert back to `en-US`.  (Note: This setting will not be saved between page loads, but you can invoke the key combination as often as you need.)
